# Flat persistence diagrams to visualize persistent homology

## Purpose

Make up for deficiencies in conventional persistence diagrams to more effectively visualize persistent homology as part of topological data analysis.

## Reproduce figures

The figures from the [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04567) can be automatically and exactly reproduced by running the following on Terminal:

```r
git clone https://github.com/rrrlw/visual-tda
cd visual-tda
Rscript figs-example.R
```

The following software is necessary to successfully run the code in this repository:

* Git
* R programming language (>= 3.5)
* TDAstats R pacakge (CRAN version >= 0.5 or [development version](https://github.com/rrrlw/TDAstats))

All contributions are welcome.
